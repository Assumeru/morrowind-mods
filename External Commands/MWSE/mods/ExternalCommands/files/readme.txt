This directory is where you can put your lua files you want to execute from a "file" package.

If using Mod Organizer 2, be sure not to delete the files when updating External Commands. Putting your files in a separate MO2 mod that shares this directory would work best.

I've included an examples directory. You can copy those files into this directory and make changes, if your chat bot requires simple dispatches.

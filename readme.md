# NullCascade's Mods

This repository contains some of the mods I have created for *The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind*. These primarily use the new Lua modding API available in MWSE 2.1.

## Assetless No-Glow

Pluginless *and* assetless no-glow. Use less memory, be more compatible!

## Controlled Consumption

Provides a configurable restriction on the amount of potions the player can drink at any one time, removing one of the largest exploits in the game.

## Diligent Defenders

This module makes it so that when the player or the player's companions are attacked, any companions will launch into action in defense.

Display information about your current game in Discord.

Ensures that your followers get warped to you if they get too far away. Compatible with any follower from any mod, without any special script attached to that NPC.

## Expeditious Exit

Have problems crashing when exiting? Lose focus of your cursor? This might help!

## Get Lost

Is removing all automatic mapping from the game a good idea? Probably not. But this mod does just that.

## Happy Harvesting

This mod provides a very simple, generic-case auto-harvesting for organic containers in Morrowind.

* Download: [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45627)

## Limited Leaping

Tired of being rewarded for spamming jump on stairs? Put a bit of a cooldown on that hopping, and a minimum fatigue required to jump.

* Download: [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46299)

## Memory Monitor

Another simple mod that warns the player if they are approaching the 4 GB memory limit.

* Download: [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45696)

## Permanently Perished

A simple permadeath mod. When you create a new character, you will be allowed to choose the number of lives the character has (defaults to 1). When the character dies, saves for that character won't be playable.

## Proportional Progression

This mod allows you to configure the rate at which skills level in a way that is more detailed than the simple game settings.

* Download: [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45697)

## Sophisticated Save System

This mod changes how saves are handled by Morrowind. The goal of the mod is to provide more types of autosaves, as well as a rotating list of quicksaves/autosaves so that the player always has a save to go back to.

## Sounds of Souls

Ever think that it's a bit creepy that there are souls trapped just there, on your desk? Would it be even creepier if the souls spoke from beyond the grave? This mod makes them do just that!

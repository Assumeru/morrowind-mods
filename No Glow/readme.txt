=====================================================================================
 REQUIREMENTS:
=====================================================================================

 This is a MWSE-Lua mod, and requires a valid installation of MWSE 2.1 or later.

    * Morrowind, Tribunal, and Bloodmoon.
    * MGE-XE 0.10.0
    * MWSE 2.1

=====================================================================================
 ABOUT THIS MOD:
=====================================================================================

 The vanilla enchanted item effect is rather ugly. A few mods exist to hide the
 "plastic wrap" effect offered by the base game, usually by making the textures that
 it uses invisible. However, the game still goes through the effort of creating and
 manipulating these textures.

 This mod prevents the game from ever applying or creating an effect in the first
 place, making it both more efficient than those other mods and more compatible, as
 other mods can still make use of the enchanted assets without them going invisible.

=====================================================================================
 INSTALLATION:
=====================================================================================

 Extract the archive into your Morrowind installation directory. The mod should
 contain the following files:
    .\Data Files\MWSE\mods\NoGlow\main.lua

=====================================================================================
 PLAYING THIS PLUGIN:

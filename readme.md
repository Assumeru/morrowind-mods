# NullCascade's Mods

This repository contains some of the mods I have created for *The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind*. These primarily use the new Lua modding API available in MWSE 2.1.

## Sophisticated Save System

This mod changes how saves are handled by Morrowind. The goal of the mod is to provide more types of autosaves, as well as a rotating list of quicksaves/autosaves so that the player always has a save to go back to.

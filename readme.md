# NullCascade's Mods

This repository contains some of the mods I have created for *The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind*. These primarily use the new Lua modding API available in MWSE 2.1.

## Controlled Consumption

Provides a configurable restriction on the amount of potions the player can drink at any one time, removing one of the largest exploits in the game.

## Proportional Progression

This mod allows you to configure the rate at which skills level in a way that is more detailed than the simple game settings.

## Sophisticated Save System

This mod changes how saves are handled by Morrowind. The goal of the mod is to provide more types of autosaves, as well as a rotating list of quicksaves/autosaves so that the player always has a save to go back to.

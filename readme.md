# NullCascade's Mods

This repository contains some of the mods I have created for *The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind*. These primarily use the new Lua modding API available in MWSE 2.1.

## Controlled Consumption

Provides a configurable restriction on the amount of potions the player can drink at any one time, removing one of the largest exploits in the game.

Have problems crashing when exiting? Lose focus of your cursor? This might help!

## Sophisticated Save System

This mod changes how saves are handled by Morrowind. The goal of the mod is to provide more types of autosaves, as well as a rotating list of quicksaves/autosaves so that the player always has a save to go back to.
